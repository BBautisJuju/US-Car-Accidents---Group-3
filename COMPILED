## Conditions and Severity

```{r car-accident-severity-chart, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)

# Calculate percentages and prepare labels
plot_data <- Data_Set_4 |>
  count(Weather_Category, Severity) |>
  group_by(Weather_Category) |>
  mutate(
    pct = n / sum(n),

  ) |>
  ungroup()

# Plot with improved label styling
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = reorder(Weather_Category, n), y = n, fill = factor(Severity))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(
    aes(label = label),
    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
    size = 4,                # Slightly bigger text
    fontface = "bold",       # Make it bold
    color = "white"          # White text for contrast
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "1" = "#FFD700",   # yellow
      "2" = "#FFA500",   # orange
      "3" = "#FF0000",   # red
      "4" = "#0000FF",   # blue
      "5" = "#008000"    # green (if applicable)
    )
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Accidents by Weather and Severity",
    x = "Weather Category",
    y = "Number of Accidents",
    fill = "Severity Level"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```

-   **Most accidents under all weather conditions are classified as Severity Level 2 (orange)**, indicating moderate severity is the most common outcome regardless of weather type.

-   **Severe accidents (Levels 3 and 4) occur more frequently during Clear / Fair conditions** than in adverse weather, likely due to higher traffic volumes or driver overconfidence.

## Re-Group Weather Categories

```{r}
Data_Set_4_grouped <- Data_Set_4 |> 
  mutate(Weather_Group = case_when(
    grepl("Rain|Drizzle", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Rain",
    grepl("Snow|Sleet|Ice", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Snow/Ice",
    grepl("Fog|Mist|Haze", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Fog",
    grepl("Clear|Fair", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Clear",
    grepl("Cloud|Overcast", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Cloudy",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
```

## Accident Counts by Weather Group

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot_data <- Data_Set_4_grouped |>
  count(Weather_Group, Severity) |>
  group_by(Weather_Group) |>
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Percent = n / Total * 100
  ) |>
  ungroup()

# Plot
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = reorder(Weather_Group, Total), y = n, fill = factor(Severity))) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
geom_text(
  aes(label = ifelse(Percent >= 20, paste0(round(Percent, 0), "%"), "")),
  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
  size = 3,
  color = "black",
  family = "sans"
) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +  # comma-formatted y-axis
  labs(
    title = "Accident Counts by Weather Group with Severity % Labels",
    x = "Weather Condition",
    y = "Number of Accidents",
    fill = "Severity Level"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # larger base font
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 13),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

-   **Clear and Cloudy conditions** have the highest overall number of accidents by far compared to other weather groups.

-   Across all weather types, **Severity Level 2 (likely moderate accidents)** makes up the largest portion—typically around **75–80%**.

-   In **Cloudy and Clear weather**, about **20–21%** of accidents are more serious (Severity Level 3), which is higher than in other conditions.

-   **Rain, Fog, Snow/Ice, and Other** weather groups show relatively **few severe accidents** above 25%, so only the most frequent severity is labeled.

## Chi-Square Test

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Chi-Square Test
weather_group_counts <- Data_Set_4_grouped |> 
  count(Weather_Group)

chisq_test_result <- chisq.test(weather_group_counts$n)
chisq_test_result
```

**Interpretation:** - X² = 1,224,743 with 5 degrees of freedom. - p-value \< 2.2e-16. - We reject the null hypothesis. - Accident frequency significantly depends on weather group.

-   The **p-value is extremely small (\< 2.2e-16)**, which means the result is very unlikely to be due to random chance.

-   We **reject the null hypothesis**, which assumed accident counts are evenly spread across weather groups.

-   This tells us that **accident frequency is significantly related to the weather group**—some weather types have more accidents than others.

## Standardized Residuals

```{r}
chisq_test_result$stdres
```

**Interpretation:** - Cloudy and Clear: way more accidents than expected. - Rain, Other, Snow/Ice, Fog: fewer accidents than expected. - Residuals \> 2 in magnitude → highly statistically significant differences.

-   **Cloudy and Clear** weather had **much more accidents than expected**, based on the overall distribution.

-   **Rain, Fog, Snow/Ice, and Other** had **fewer accidents than expected**.

-   Since all residuals are much greater than **2 in magnitude**, the differences are **highly statistically significant**.

## Logistic Regression: Probability of Severe Accident

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create Binary Outcome
Data_Set_4_grouped <- Data_Set_4_grouped |> 
  mutate(Severe_Accident = ifelse(Severity >= 3, 1, 0))

# Logistic Regression Model
model <- glm(Severe_Accident ~ Weather_Group, data = Data_Set_4_grouped, family = "binomial")

# Model Summary
summary(model)
```

All coefficients are statistically significant (p \< 0.001).

-   **Clear weather is the baseline**: The model compares all other weather types to clear weather, which is treated as the “normal” or reference point.

    **Bad weather = higher risk**: Cloudy, foggy, rainy, snowy/icy, and other weather conditions all lead to a higher chance of a severe accident compared to clear weather.

    **Cloudy and rainy are especially risky**: These two conditions have the highest increase in the chance of a serious accident.

    **The results are very trustworthy**: All the numbers are statistically significant, meaning the differences aren’t due to random chance.

# Key Takeaways

**Weather significantly influences accidents** — frequency and severity vary across conditions (p \< 0.001).

**Clear and Cloudy weather account for the most accidents**, likely due to higher traffic volume and exposure.

**Severity Level 2 (moderate)** is the most common across all weather types.

**Cloudy and Rainy conditions increase the odds of severe accidents**, as shown in the logistic regression.

## Introduction

In this section of the group project, we will explore two primary research questions:

1. What is the most common **type** of traffic accident?
2. What are the most common **causes** of those accidents?

accidents %>%
  count(Type_of_collision, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Type_of_collision, n), y = n)) +

## Analysis: Bar Chart - Accident Types

- Rear-end collisions are the most common, followed by head-on and side-swipe crashes.
- These often result from inattention, tailgating, and failure to follow traffic rules.
- Driver’s ed can focus more on reaction time and following distance.
- Techniques like simulated braking and interactive drills can reinforce safer habits.
- AR scenarios can improve spatial awareness and lane control.

---

## Most Common Accident Types (Pie Chart)

```{r accident-type-pie, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Type_of_collision, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = Type_of_collision)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Accident Type Distribution") +
  theme_void()
```

---

## Analysis: Pie Chart - Accident Types

- A few types dominate most accidents: rear-end, head-on, and single-vehicle.
- Emphasizing these in training helps allocate learning time efficiently.
- Virtual driving sims could offer specific high-risk scenario training.
- Short-form video modules with real dashcam footage can boost attention and retention.

## Most Common Accident Causes (Bar Chart)

```{r accident-cause-bar, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Cause_of_accident, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Cause_of_accident, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "tomato") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Causes of Accidents",
       x = "Cause",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## Analysis: Bar Chart - Accident Causes

- Speeding and distracted driving are the top causes of accidents.
- These behaviors reduce response time and lead to serious injuries.
- Traditional lectures are not enough to address behavioral habits.
- Distraction simulators and gamified modules could engage students better.
- Real stories and interactive challenges create emotional impact.

---

## Most Common Accident Causes (Pie Chart)

```{r accident-cause-pie, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Cause_of_accident, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = Cause_of_accident)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Accident Cause Distribution") +
  theme_void()
```

---

## Analysis: Pie Chart - Accident Causes

- Speeding and distractions make up the majority of accidents.
- These are habit-based, not knowledge-based mistakes.
- Driver contracts and self-evaluations can build accountability.
- Apps with post-drive feedback can turn real habits into learning moments.
- AI tools can coach new drivers with personalized safety tips.

---

## Summary & Recommendations

- **Rear-end and head-on collisions** are the most common accident types.
- **Speeding and distracted driving** are the primary causes.
- Drivers' education should evolve to use:
  - Interactive and immersive technologies (e.g., AR/VR)
  - Scenario-based learning with decision trees
  - Behavior-modifying feedback tools

By targeting the most frequent accident types and causes, training programs can become more effective, data-driven, and life-saving.
