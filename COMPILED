    size = 4,                # Slightly bigger text
    fontface = "bold",       # Make it bold

      "3" = "#FF0000",   # red
      "4" = "#0000FF",   # blue
      "5" = "#008000"    # green (if applicable)
    )
  ) +

    x = "Weather Category",
    y = "Number of Accidents",
    fill = "Severity Level"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```

-   **Most accidents under all weather conditions are classified as Severity Level 2 (orange)**, indicating moderate severity is the most common outcome regardless of weather type.

-   **Severe accidents (Levels 3 and 4) occur more frequently during Clear / Fair conditions** than in adverse weather, likely due to higher traffic volumes or driver overconfidence.

## Re-Group Weather Categories

```{r}
Data_Set_4_grouped <- Data_Set_4 |> 
  mutate(Weather_Group = case_when(
    grepl("Rain|Drizzle", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Rain",
    grepl("Snow|Sleet|Ice", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Snow/Ice",
    grepl("Fog|Mist|Haze", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Fog",
    grepl("Clear|Fair", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Clear",
    grepl("Cloud|Overcast", Weather_Condition, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Cloudy",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
```

## Accident Counts by Weather Group

```{r,echo=FALSE}
plot_data <- Data_Set_4_grouped |>
  count(Weather_Group, Severity) |>
  group_by(Weather_Group) |>
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Percent = n / Total * 100
  ) |>
  ungroup()

# Plot
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = reorder(Weather_Group, Total), y = n, fill = factor(Severity))) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
geom_text(
  aes(label = ifelse(Percent >= 20, paste0(round(Percent, 0), "%"), "")),
  position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
  size = 3,
  color = "black",
  family = "sans"
) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +  # comma-formatted y-axis
  labs(
    title = "Accident Counts by Weather Group with Severity % Labels",
    x = "Weather Condition",
    y = "Number of Accidents",
    fill = "Severity Level"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # larger base font
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 13),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11)
  )
```

-   **Clear and Cloudy conditions** have the highest overall number of accidents by far compared to other weather groups.

-   Across all weather types, **Severity Level 2 (likely moderate accidents)** makes up the largest portion—typically around **75–80%**.

-   In **Cloudy and Clear weather**, about **20–21%** of accidents are more serious (Severity Level 3), which is higher than in other conditions.

-   **Rain, Fog, Snow/Ice, and Other** weather groups show relatively **few severe accidents** above 25%, so only the most frequent severity is labeled.

## Chi-Square Test

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Chi-Square Test
weather_group_counts <- Data_Set_4_grouped |> 
  count(Weather_Group)

chisq_test_result <- chisq.test(weather_group_counts$n)
chisq_test_result
```

**Interpretation:** - X² = 1,224,743 with 5 degrees of freedom. - p-value \< 2.2e-16. - We reject the null hypothesis. - Accident frequency significantly depends on weather group.

-   The **p-value is extremely small (\< 2.2e-16)**, which means the result is very unlikely to be due to random chance.

-   We **reject the null hypothesis**, which assumed accident counts are evenly spread across weather groups.

-   This tells us that **accident frequency is significantly related to the weather group**—some weather types have more accidents than others.

## Standardized Residuals

```{r}
chisq_test_result$stdres
```

**Interpretation:** - Cloudy and Clear: way more accidents than expected. - Rain, Other, Snow/Ice, Fog: fewer accidents than expected. - Residuals \> 2 in magnitude → highly statistically significant differences.

-   **Cloudy and Clear** weather had **much more accidents than expected**, based on the overall distribution.

-   **Rain, Fog, Snow/Ice, and Other** had **fewer accidents than expected**.

-   Since all residuals are much greater than **2 in magnitude**, the differences are **highly statistically significant**.

## Logistic Regression: Probability of Severe Accident

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create Binary Outcome
Data_Set_4_grouped <- Data_Set_4_grouped |> 
  mutate(Severe_Accident = ifelse(Severity >= 3, 1, 0))

# Logistic Regression Model
model <- glm(Severe_Accident ~ Weather_Group, data = Data_Set_4_grouped, family = "binomial")

# Model Summary
summary(model)
```

All coefficients are statistically significant (p \< 0.001).

-   **Clear weather is the baseline**: The model compares all other weather types to clear weather, which is treated as the “normal” or reference point.

    **Bad weather = higher risk**: Cloudy, foggy, rainy, snowy/icy, and other weather conditions all lead to a higher chance of a severe accident compared to clear weather.

    **Cloudy and rainy are especially risky**: These two conditions have the highest increase in the chance of a serious accident.

    **The results are very trustworthy**: All the numbers are statistically significant, meaning the differences aren’t due to random chance.

# Key Takeaways

**Weather significantly influences accidents** — frequency and severity vary across conditions (p \< 0.001).

**Clear and Cloudy weather account for the most accidents**, likely due to higher traffic volume and exposure.

**Severity Level 2 (moderate)** is the most common across all weather types.

**Cloudy and Rainy conditions increase the odds of severe accidents**, as shown in the logistic regression.


## R03 What geographical locations are more likely to have higher accident rates? Cities or states.?

## State Level Trends 

- States like California, Texas, and Florida often report the highest total accident counts due to population density and highway networks.

- However, when normalized per capita or per mile driven, smaller states or dense urban states (e.g., New Jersey) may have higher rates per person or per vehicle.

- For insurance companies 

- Adjust premiums based on regional accident risks. 
- Detect fraud by comparing claims vs normalized accident rates.
- Guide market entry/exit decisions using geographic risk profiles. 

- For DOT 

- Prioritize safety improvements in high-risk areas. 
- Allocate infrastructure funds based on per capita or VMT data 
- Target public safety campagains where accidents are most frequent. 

## Top 10 Cities 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Step 1: Filter for the lower 48 states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii)
lower_48_data <- Clean_Data_Geography %>%
  filter(State != "AK", State != "HI")

# Step 2: Count accidents by City
accidents_by_city <- lower_48_data %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarize(accident_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(accident_count))

# Step 3: Select the top 10 cities with the most accidents
top_10_cities <- accidents_by_city %>%
  top_n(10, wt = accident_count)

# Step 4: Plot the bar chart
ggplot(top_10_cities, aes(x = reorder(City, -accident_count), y = accident_count, fill = accident_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Cities by Accidents in the Lower 48 States", x = "City", y = "Number of Accidents") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

## Top 10 Cities Results 

- Major cities like Miami Los Angeles, Houston, and Charlott lead in accident volume.

- Urban areas contribute a disproportionate share of total accidents.

- DOT Use: 
- Target hotspots for infrastructure and traffic safety improvements.
- Allocate resources effectively to high-accident areas.
- Inform policy with data on urban vs. rural crash trends.

- Insurance Use: 
- Price premiums based on regional risk.
- Forecast claims in high-incident zones.
- Detect fraud via geographic claim patterns.

## Los Angeles and Orange County Top 20 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Step 1: Filter for LA and Orange Counties
la_oc_data <- Clean_Data_Geography %>%
  filter(State == "CA", County %in% c("Los Angeles", "Orange"))

# Step 2: Count accidents by City
accidents_by_city <- la_oc_data %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarize(accident_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(accident_count))

# Step 3: Select the top 20 cities with the most accidents
top_20_cities <- accidents_by_city %>%
  top_n(20, wt = accident_count)

# Step 4: Plot the bar chart
ggplot(top_20_cities, aes(x = reorder(City, -accident_count), y = accident_count, fill = accident_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Cities by Accidents in LA & Orange Counties", x = "City", y = "Number of Accidents") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

## Future Developments for More Accurate Analysis 

- Normalize by Population: Merge with census data to calculate per capita crash rates.

- Adjust for Traffic Volume: Use VMT to reveal true risk exposure by area.

- Group Cities by Size: Bin by crash volume to classify cities as small/medium/large.

- Analyze Time Trends: Break down by time of day, week, or season to find patterns.

- Map Spatial Hotspots: Use geospatial tools to visualize high-crash areas.

- Spot Outliers: Flag cities with abnormal crash rates for further study.


## RO3 (Continued) Which locations (roads, intersections, regions) have the highest accident rates?

## The Variables to Review for Locations and the Associated Severity of the Accident 

- No Junction: A straight, uninterrupted road with no intersections or merges.

- Y Shape: A three-way intersection where one road splits or merges at an angle.

- Crossing: A general intersection where roads meet, may involve pedestrians.

- O Shape: A roundabout or traffic circle where vehicles yield to ongoing traffic.

- Other: Any non-standard or complex junction not fitting the above types.

- Unknown: Intersection type is unclear due to missing or incomplete data.

- T Shape: A three-way intersection where one road ends perpendicularly, requiring a left or right turn.

- X Shape: A four-way intersection where two roads cross at a right angle.

- Severity: 
- Severity 0 is minimal risk (no injuries)
- Severity 1 represents moderate risk (minor injuries)
- Severity 2 indicates high risk (severe injuries or fatalities)

## Takeaways from Type of Intersection and Severity of Accident 

- Y Shape and No Junction roads have the highest number of severe (Level 2) accidents.
- Crossings also show notable severity but less frequently.
- O, T, and X Shapes have low severity, suggesting safer design.
- Y Shape junctions may need redesign due to high risk.
- No Junction severity may reflect high-speed or rural roads.
- For DOT:
- Identify high-risk junction types (e.g., Y Shape) for redesign or added traffic control.
- Prioritize safety improvements on uninterrupted roads with severe accidents.
- Allocate resources more effectively for road safety interventions.
- Support data-driven policy for intersection design standards and upgrades.
- For Car Insurance:
- Refine risk models based on accident severity by junction type.
- Adjust premiums for drivers based on frequent routes or commute patterns.
- Inform customer education on high-risk road types and safe driving behavior.

Enhance fraud detection by comparing claims with typical severity at given junctions.

## Introduction

In this section of the group project, we will explore two primary research questions:

1. What is the most common **type** of traffic accident?
2. What are the most common **causes** of those accidents?

## Analysis: Bar Chart - Accident Types

- Rear-end collisions are the most common, followed by head-on and side-swipe crashes.
- These often result from inattention, tailgating, and failure to follow traffic rules.
- Driver’s ed can focus more on reaction time and following distance.
- Techniques like simulated braking and interactive drills can reinforce safer habits.
- AR scenarios can improve spatial awareness and lane control.

## Most Common Accident Types (Pie Chart)

```{r accident-type-pie, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Type_of_collision, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%

  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Accident Type Distribution") +
  theme_void()
```

---

## Analysis: Pie Chart - Accident Types

- A few types dominate most accidents: rear-end, head-on, and single-vehicle.
- Emphasizing these in training helps allocate learning time efficiently.
- Virtual driving sims could offer specific high-risk scenario training.
- Short-form video modules with real dashcam footage can boost attention and retention.
