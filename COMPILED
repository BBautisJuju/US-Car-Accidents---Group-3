# Problem Definition

To analyze and visualize patterns in road traffic accidents across the United States, using various factors such as weather conditions, severity (measured by length of traffic delay), locations, times, and contributing factors (e.g., speeding, distracted driving). The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing the frequency and severity of accidents, identify high-risk locations and times, and explore accident types and their contributing causes.

# Research Objectives

What counties have the most accidents per capita and overall within the US\

How do weather conditions influence accident frequency and severity?\

What geographical locations are more likely to have higher accident rates? Cities or states

How frequent are accidents by the hour?

What are the most common accident types and their contributing factors?

# Importance of the Topic

Improvements for pedestrian and driver safety 

Update vehicle laws/policies

Infrastructure improvements 

Risk Reduction

# Sampling/Data Collection Process

## Content of Data

\-   Data was collected in real-time using multiple traffic APIs.

\-   Data was collected from February 2016 to March 2023.

\

### Data Collection

### -   Data was collected from the National and State level Departments of Transportation (DOT)

\-   It also includes law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks.

## Introduction

In this section of the group project, we will explore two primary research questions:

1. What is the most common **type** of traffic accident?
2. What are the most common **causes** of those accidents?

# Load the dataset

## Most Common Accident Types (Bar Chart)

```{r accident-type-bar, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Type_of_collision, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Type_of_collision, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Common Accident Types",
       x = "Accident Type",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Analysis: Bar Chart - Accident Types

- Rear-end collisions are the most common, followed by head-on and side-swipe crashes.
- These often result from inattention, tailgating, and failure to follow traffic rules.
- Driver’s ed can focus more on reaction time and following distance.
- Techniques like simulated braking and interactive drills can reinforce safer habits.
- AR scenarios can improve spatial awareness and lane control.

## Most Common Accident Types (Pie Chart)

```{r accident-type-pie, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Type_of_collision, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = Type_of_collision)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Accident Type Distribution") +
  theme_void()
```

---

## Analysis: Pie Chart - Accident Types

- A few types dominate most accidents: rear-end, head-on, and single-vehicle.
- Emphasizing these in training helps allocate learning time efficiently.
- Virtual driving sims could offer specific high-risk scenario training.
- Short-form video modules with real dashcam footage can boost attention and retention.

## Most Common Accident Causes (Bar Chart)

```{r accident-cause-bar, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Cause_of_accident, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Cause_of_accident, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "tomato") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Causes of Accidents",
       x = "Cause",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## Analysis: Bar Chart - Accident Causes

- Speeding and distracted driving are the top causes of accidents.
- These behaviors reduce response time and lead to serious injuries.
- Traditional lectures are not enough to address behavioral habits.
- Distraction simulators and gamified modules could engage students better.
- Real stories and interactive challenges create emotional impact.

## Most Common Accident Causes (Pie Chart)

```{r accident-cause-pie, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
accidents %>%
  count(Cause_of_accident, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = Cause_of_accident)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Accident Cause Distribution") +
  theme_void()
```

---

## Analysis: Pie Chart - Accident Causes

- Speeding and distractions make up the majority of accidents.
- These are habit-based, not knowledge-based mistakes.
- Driver contracts and self-evaluations can build accountability.
- Apps with post-drive feedback can turn real habits into learning moments.
- AI tools can coach new drivers with personalized safety tips.

---

## Summary & Recommendations

- **Rear-end and head-on collisions** are the most common accident types.
- **Speeding and distracted driving** are the primary causes.
- Drivers' education should evolve to use:
  - Interactive and immersive technologies (e.g., AR/VR)
  - Scenario-based learning with decision trees
  - Behavior-modifying feedback tools

By targeting the most frequent accident types and causes, training programs can become more effective, data-driven, and life-saving.
